## Briefly summarize the requirements and goals of the app you developed. What user needs was this app designed to address?

My inventory app needed to have a login screen and a screen that shows all the inventory items. The login screen needed to have an option where the user can create an account if they did not already have one. The main screen needed to have options to add and remove inventory items. The user needs that this app was designed for is to keep track of inventory items.

## What screens and features were necessary to support user needs and produce a user-centered UI for the app? How did your UI designs keep users in mind? Why were your designs successful?

A login screen and a grid layout screen were necessary to support the user needs. Buttons to remove and add items were also necessary. My design keeps users in mind by being simple. The grid view looks nice while also feeling simple and easy-to-use. My designs were successful because they display what needs to be displayed and have the functionality.

## How did you approach the process of coding your app? What techniques or strategies did you use? How could those be applied in the future?

I approached the process of coding my app in steps. Coding the design of the ap was first. Then, figuring out how to implement the database was next. Having a design plan was necessary. This can be applied in the future.

## How did you test to ensure your code was functional? Why is this process important and what did it reveal?

To test the code, I used the android emulator and used the split utility within android studio. This process is important because you can see exactly what your code will look like, and you can find bugs this way.

## Considering the full app design and development process, from initial planning to finalization, where did you have to innovate to overcome a challenge?

I needed to read through a lot of documentation to get some of my code working. My ideas for my app also changed while working through the development process. I needed to think about different ways to implement my initial designs and make small tweaks to improve quality.

## In what specific component from your mobile app were you particularly successful in demonstrating your knowledge, skills, and experience?

I was most successful with my login screen. I like my grid layout the best, but I was not completely successful with that component in the end. In the future I will plan more time for a similar feature component.
